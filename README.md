## 1. Project Overview

The **McKinsey AI Market Research Engine** is a full-stack AI research application designed to automate the major stages of market research.

Instead of manually searching many websites, collecting information, checking evidence, preparing citations, and writing a final report, the system organizes the complete workflow into a **7-stage research pipeline**.

### The core idea

```text
Business Question
       ↓
Research Planning
       ↓
Web Research
       ↓
Evidence Extraction
       ↓
Evidence Validation
       ↓
Citation Building
       ↓
AI Strategy Report
       ↓
Evidence / Source Traceability
```

The architecture separates **research planning, source discovery, evidence processing, validation, report generation, and traceability** so that the final report can be connected back to supporting research.

# 2. 30-Second Explanation for an Instructor

> **“This project is an AI-powered market research engine. A user enters a research question through the React frontend. The FastAPI backend sends the request through seven specialized stages: Planner, Research, Extraction, Validation, Citation Builder, Report Agent, and Report Linker. Tavily is used for web research, Google Gemini is used for AI reasoning and generation, and Supabase provides authentication and persistent storage. The final output is a structured strategy report with citations and links back to the underlying evidence and sources.”**

# 4. What Problem Does It Solve?

Traditional market research can require:

- Searching many web pages
- Reading and comparing sources
- Extracting useful facts
- Checking whether evidence supports claims
- Organizing research findings
- Building citations
- Writing a strategic report
- Connecting final conclusions to original sources

This project turns those activities into a structured software workflow.

# 6. The 7-Stage AI Research Pipeline

The most important part of the project is the **7-stage research pipeline**.

    P["1. Planner<br/>Create research plan"]
    R["2. Research<br/>Find sources"]
    E["3. Extraction<br/>Extract evidence"]

    OUT["Final Strategy Report<br/>+ Citations + Traceability"]

    Q --> P --> R --> E --> V --> C --> A --> L --> OUT
```

---

## Stage 1 — Planner Agent

### Responsibility

The Planner Agent converts the user's research question into a structured research plan.

### Input

```text
User's research question
```

### Processing

```text
Broad Question
      ↓
Identify research areas
      ↓
Break into tasks
      ↓
Create structured research plan
```

### Output

```text
Structured research tasks
```

### Why it matters

A broad question is easier to research when it is divided into smaller, focused tasks.

---

## Stage 2 — Research Agent

### Responsibility

The Research Agent searches the web for relevant information.

### Technology

**Tavily**

```text
Research Task
     ↓
Tavily Search
     ↓
Relevant Web Sources
     ↓
Source Collection
```

The goal is to collect source material that can be processed in later stages.

---

## Stage 3 — Extraction Agent

### Responsibility

The Extraction Agent processes collected source information and identifies useful evidence.

```text
Web Source
    ↓
Content
    ↓
Relevant Information
    ↓
Extracted Evidence
```

Google Gemini can be used for AI-assisted extraction and reasoning, while source/search information is supplied by the research stage.

---

## Stage 4 — Validation Agent

### Responsibility

The Validation Agent checks whether extracted evidence is suitable for use.

```text
Extracted Evidence
       ↓
Validation
       ↓
Supported / Usable Evidence
       ↓
Continue to Report Pipeline
```

This stage is important because the final report should not simply repeat every piece of information found during research.

---

## Stage 5 — Citation Builder

### Responsibility

The Citation Builder connects report-ready evidence to source information.

```text
Validated Evidence
       ↓
Source Information
       ↓
Citation
       ↓
Report-Ready Reference
```

This creates a stronger relationship between **what the report says** and **where the information came from**.

---

## Stage 6 — Report Agent

### Responsibility

The Report Agent synthesizes validated research into a structured strategy report.

```text
Validated Evidence
       +
Citations
       ↓
Report Agent
       ↓
Structured Strategy Report
```

Google Gemini is used for AI-powered report generation.

---

## Stage 7 — Report Linker

### Responsibility

The Report Linker preserves the connection between the final report and the underlying evidence/source records.

```text
Final Report
    ↓
Report Finding
    ↓
Evidence
    ↓
Source
    ↓
Original URL
```

This is the project's **traceability layer**.

### Data transformation

| Step | Data Produced |
|---|---|
| User Input | Research question |
| Planner | Structured research plan |
| Research | Source records |
| Extraction | Evidence records |
| Validation | Validation records |
| Citation Builder | Citation information |
| Report Agent | Report content |
| Report Linker | Evidence/source links |
| Supabase | Persistent research artifacts |

---

# 9. Evidence-to-Citation Traceability

One of the strongest architectural ideas in the project is that the report is not treated as an isolated block of AI-generated text.

```mermaid
flowchart LR
    F["📌 Report Finding"]
    E["🧾 Evidence"]
    S["🌐 Source"]
    U["🔗 Original URL"]

    F --> E
    E --> S
    S --> U
```

### Example concept

```text
Report Finding
      ↓
Evidence ID
      ↓
Source ID
      ↓
Source Title / Metadata
      ↓
Original URL
```

This makes it easier to explain:

> **“Where did this statement in the report come from?”**

```

### Architectural principle

The API layer should receive and validate requests, while the **research service/pipeline** handles the multi-stage research process.

---

# 15. Project Folder Architecture

The repository contains separate frontend and backend applications.

---

# 16. Backend File Organization

The backend contains the API, research pipeline, models/services, configuration and tests.

A simplified conceptual structure is:

```text

│
├── routes/
│   └── research API
│
├── agents/
│   ├── Planner
│   ├── Research

│   ├── test_pipeline_resilience.py
│   ├── test_tavily_retries.py
│   └── test_validation_resilience.py
│
└── requirements.txt
```

The exact implementation should be understood from the repository source files; this diagram is an instructor-friendly architectural view.

---

# 17. Database Architecture

The project uses **Supabase PostgreSQL** for persistent application data.

The migration files define tables including:

```text
research_jobs
planner_tasks
sources
evidence
validation_records
memory_records
reports
feedback
```

### Conceptual data model

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    JOB["research_jobs"]

    TASK["planner_tasks"]
    SOURCE["sources"]
    EVIDENCE["evidence"]
    VALID["validation_records"]
    REPORT["reports"]
    FEEDBACK["feedback"]
    MEMORY["memory_records"]

    JOB --> TASK
    JOB --> SOURCE
    SOURCE --> EVIDENCE
    EVIDENCE --> VALID
    JOB --> REPORT
    REPORT --> FEEDBACK

    MEMORY -.-> JOB
```

> **Note:** This is a conceptual architecture diagram based on the project’s database objects. It is intended to explain the system to an instructor rather than replace the SQL migration definitions.

---

# 18. Database Responsibilities

| Table / Object | Conceptual Purpose |
|---|---|
| `research_jobs` | Stores research-job information |
| `planner_tasks` | Stores tasks produced by research planning |
| `sources` | Stores source information collected during research |
| `evidence` | Stores extracted research evidence |
| `validation_records` | Stores evidence validation information |
| `memory_records` | Stores project memory-related records |
| `reports` | Stores generated reports |
| `feedback` | Stores feedback information |

---

# 19. Authentication Flow

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant U as User
    participant F as React
    participant S as Supabase Auth
    participant B as FastAPI

    U->>F: Login / Sign Up
    F->>S: Authentication request
    S-->>F: Session / Token
    F->>B: API request with authentication context
    B->>S: Validate authentication
    S-->>B: Authentication result
    B-->>F: Authorized response
    F-->>U: Application screen
```

---

# 20. External AI and Search Services

The system depends on two major external services.

## Google Gemini

Used for AI-powered processing within the research pipeline.

Conceptually:

```text
Research Task
     ↓
Gemini
     ↓
AI-generated structured output
```

Relevant pipeline stages include planning, evidence processing/validation support, and report generation.

---

## Tavily

Used for web research and source discovery.

```text
Research Task
     ↓
Tavily Search
     ↓
Web Results
     ↓
Source Collection
```

---

# 21. External Service Resilience

The project includes tests focused on resilience around external services.

Present test files include:

```text
test_gemini_retries.py
test_tavily_retries.py
test_pipeline_resilience.py
test_extraction_resilience.py
test_validation_resilience.py
```

This is important because the research engine depends on external AI and search services.

### Conceptual resilience flow

```text
External Service Request
        ↓
     Success?
      /    \
    YES     NO
     ↓      ↓
 Continue   Retry / Resilience Logic
              ↓
          Continue / Handle Failure
```

---

# 22. API Overview

The main research API is exposed under:

```text
/api/research
```

The FastAPI application also provides standard API documentation endpoints.

### Local API documentation

```text
http://localhost:8000/docs
```

### ReDoc

```text
http://localhost:8000/redoc
```

### Health endpoint

```text
http://localhost:8000/health
```

The exact request/response schema should be taken from the current backend route and Pydantic models.

---

# 29. Architecture Design Principles

## 1. Separation of responsibilities

Each research stage has a focused responsibility.

```text
Planner       → What should we research?
Research      → Where can we find information?
Extraction    → What evidence is useful?
Validation    → Is the evidence usable?
Citation      → How do we reference it?
Report        → How do we synthesize it?
Linker        → Where did each finding come from?
```

---

## 2. Evidence-first reporting

The pipeline places evidence processing before final report generation.

```text
Research
   ↓
Evidence
   ↓
Validation
   ↓
Citation
   ↓
Report
```

This is preferable to simply asking an LLM to generate a report directly from a question.

---

## 3. Traceability

The system preserves a conceptual path:

```text
Question
  ↓
Task
  ↓
Source
  ↓
Evidence
  ↓
Validation
  ↓
Citation
  ↓
Report Finding
```

---

## 4. External service separation

AI reasoning and web research are provided by separate external services.

```text
Gemini → AI processing / generation
Tavily → Web research / search
```

This keeps the research architecture conceptually separated.

---

# 30. Testing

The repository includes tests focused on research-pipeline reliability.

### Current test files

```text
backened/.../test_extraction_resilience.py
backened/.../test_gemini_retries.py
backened/.../test_pipeline_resilience.py
backened/.../test_tavily_retries.py
backened/.../test_validation_resilience.py
```

### Testing focus

```text
Extraction resilience
        +
Gemini retry behavior
        +
Pipeline resilience
        +
Tavily retry behavior
        +
Validation resilience
```

The exact test commands depend on the backend test configuration in the repository.

---

# 31. Documentation Included in the Project

The repository contains additional project documentation:

```text
project-docs/
│
├── API.md
├── ARCHITECTURE.md
├── DEPLOYMENT.md
└── EVALUATION.md
```

These documents can be used alongside this README when explaining the implementation in detail.

---

# 32. Deployment Architecture

The logical production architecture can be represented as:

```mermaid
flowchart TB
    USER["Users"]

    WEB["Frontend Application"]
    API["FastAPI Backend"]

    AUTH["Supabase Auth"]
    DB[("Supabase PostgreSQL")]

    GEM["Google Gemini"]
    TAV["Tavily"]

    USER --> WEB
    WEB --> AUTH
    WEB --> API

    API --> GEM
    API --> TAV
    API --> DB
    API --> AUTH

    DB --> API
    API --> WEB
```

The repository also contains:

```text
project-docs/DEPLOYMENT.md
```

for deployment-specific project documentation.

---

# 33. Security Considerations

The application uses authentication and environment-based credentials.

### Important rules

- Keep API keys in environment variables.
- Do not commit `.env` files containing secrets.
- Do not expose private API keys in frontend source code.
- Use the appropriate Supabase key for the intended client/server context.
- Validate API inputs through backend models.
- Keep authentication checks in the backend/API flow.

---

# 34. Error Handling Concept

The system interacts with external services, so failures can occur.

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    A["Pipeline Stage"]
    B{"External Request Successful?"}
    C["Continue Pipeline"]
    D["Retry / Resilience Logic"]
    E{"Recovered?"}
    F["Continue"]
    G["Handle Failure"]

    A --> B
    B -->|Yes| C
    B -->|No| D
    D --> E
    E -->|Yes| F
    E -->|No| G
```

This architecture is supported by the project's resilience-oriented tests.

---

# 35. Strengths of the Architecture

| Strength | Explanation |
|---|---|
| **Modular pipeline** | Research is divided into understandable stages |
| **Evidence validation** | Evidence is processed before report generation |
| **Source traceability** | Reports can be connected to evidence and sources |
| **AI + search separation** | Gemini and Tavily have distinct roles |
| **Full-stack implementation** | React frontend + FastAPI backend + database |
| **Persistent storage** | Research artifacts can be stored in Supabase |
| **Authentication** | User authentication is handled through Supabase |
| **Resilience testing** | External service failures are explicitly considered |
| **API documentation** | FastAPI exposes interactive documentation |
| **Expandable design** | Pipeline stages can be developed independently |

---

# 36. Limitations to Explain Honestly

The README should not imply that AI-generated research is automatically perfect.

Potential limitations include:

- Web sources can change or become unavailable.
- AI extraction and summarization can still require human review.
- Search quality depends on the research query and available sources.
- External Gemini/Tavily services require valid API access.
- The quality of the final report depends on the quality of collected evidence.
- The exact production deployment configuration depends on the project's deployment environment.

A strong project presentation should describe the system as an **evidence-driven research assistant**, not as a replacement for expert judgment.

---

# 37. Future Enhancement Ideas

Possible future improvements include:
